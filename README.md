# 32 bit(parameterized) accumulator UVM verifications.
A clocked 32bit signed accumulator targeted for FPGA designs. For a higher clock frequency, pipelining is desired.

The UVM test runs under Xilinx Vivado 2021.2 with the script UVM_Tests/brun

TODO:
	. handle buffer clear bit properly in UVM.
	. accumulator width != 32.
